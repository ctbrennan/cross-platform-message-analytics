A work in progress in Python.
Currently parses iMessage database files, Android SMS archives, and Facebook message archives and puts them in various data structures, combining communications with the same people in chronological order across platforms.
Automatically resolves differences in how people are named. Trying out using minimum edit distances and parts of nltk (or will it be sci-kit learn?)
Started work on analytic tools. Currently creates line graphs of communication with your closest friends using matplotlib and generates wordclouds for any individual.
